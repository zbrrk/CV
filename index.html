  <h3>Biography</h3>
  <p>A radiant from Tokyo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> Yoru is a man dedicated to uncovering his past.Specifically interested in his ancestors and an ancient order of samurai, Yoru's search has kept on bringing him to
    Kingdom's S22 container port, where he first found
    his mask that allows him to see into another dimension after he broke into the facility and stole it.[2][3] He was later recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its fifteenth agent, and shortly after this his familiarity with S22 saw him returning
    there on assignment to prevent a spike detonation by assailants from the Mirror Earth.</p>
